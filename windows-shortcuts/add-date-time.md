# Add date time: Ctr+Shift+[D, T, F]

Any way to automatically pre-pend the date to the page title?

> It's not automatic, but the keyboard shortcut "Alt+Shift+D" does this. If you change your default date format in the OS settings you can change the formatting too (YYYY-MM-DD vs. MM/DD/YYYY). There's also "Alt+Shift+T" for the current time, and "Alt+Shift+F" for both. [<sup>1</sup>][1]
